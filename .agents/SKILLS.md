# Curated Project Skill Routing

This repository keeps task-specific Skills in .agents/skills. Codex and Claude entry directories point to the same project-owned copies where links are present.

This table records the Skills reviewed or added by the 2026-09-11 audit; it does not remove or replace other project-owned Skills already present in the repository.

Load only the Skill whose trigger matches the current task. A Skill may be reused by several projects, and this project may use several Skills. Existing repository instructions and the user's current request take priority over a Skill.

| Skill | Use here for |
|---|---|
| `minimax-studio-maintenance` | Current missing backend entrypoint, mode detection, fake-key media mocks, retries and usable downloads |
| `puppeteer-automation` | Existing browser automation workflow |
| `github-actions` | Static publishing and security workflows |
| `frontend-design` | Studio interface design |
| `webapp-testing` | Local browser-flow verification |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | Searchable UX, accessibility, and interface guidance |

## Maintenance rules

- Keep domain and implementation Skills in the project instead of the global Codex Skill directory.
- Preserve project-specific Skills as the source of truth; do not replace them with an archived global copy.
- Prefer links for IDE-specific discovery so Codex and Claude read the same maintained content.
- Add or expand a Skill only when it captures repeatable project knowledge that is not already clear from code or repository documentation.
- For small changes, run focused checks first and expand testing only when failures, risk, or new scope justify it.

## Source-based routing update — 2026-10-03

Start with the project-specific skill above for product/data/runtime work; load
UI, testing or architecture specialists only when that narrower task needs them.
The source maps record an inspection date, not a new runtime or deployment pass.
